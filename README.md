# 🐬 CodeRed

I'm a passionate and driven Computer Engineering student with a strong interest in web development, mobile development, and cybersecurity. I enjoy building practical, user-focused applications while continuously learning how systems work under the hood — from frontend interfaces to backend logic and secure architectures.

My long-term goal is to become a well-rounded full-stack developer with solid foundations in secure software development, modern frameworks, and efficient algorithms.

I believe in learning by building, and I’m constantly improving my skills through hands-on projects, experimentation, and problem-solving.
